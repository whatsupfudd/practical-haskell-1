    "- it enforces immutability: a variable is assigned once (or *a term is bound to a name once only* the functional people would say),\n",
    "- it has a strong support for pure logic without side effects: logic with the same inputs will always produce the same results, as theoritical computing expects would have it,\n",
    "- it has a consistent support for practical computing: side effects and evolving execution contexts are required in real-life software, so that's also managed in the framework,\n",
    "- it has a very powerful typing system that is also strongly enforced: anything is typed (even types themselves!), type matching must be exact for code to be accepted, there are types of types and type manipulations, etc,\n",
    "- its typing system is powerful enough that it disappears from normal use: you write your code without types (a la JS) and Haskell figures out the rest (unlike JS!),\n",
    "- it supports meta-programming: GHC contains a VM that can execute codes during compilation, leading to on-the-fly extra code generation, value derivation, interaction with the outside world, etc,\n",
    "- it is extendable: new syntax can be created and added to Haskell to express domain-specific ideas, eg embedded SQL, and a powerful FFI provides an easy integration of existing C/C++ code,\n",
    "- it is very optimizable: all kind of directives will drive the compiler to producte efficient machine code, the runtime to work with memory or garbage-collection constraints, as well as using Linear Types provide a way to execute code without garbage-collection (a la Rust)."

    "- it is parallel: the concept of threading is built-in, and execution can happen in all kind of (safe) levels of parallelism depending on the underlying hardware,\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a pause for a moment and note that there has been no explicit use of typing for any of the code except for actually showing off the typing notation.  A significant advantage of the Haskell language is that while it is (very) strongly-typed, the typing system is so powerful that you rarely need to bother with type annotation like one would do in C, Java or Rust. The compiler can figure out the logical typing arrangements and run code (idem for the interpreter); or if something is too vague it can alert the developer that the logic isn't sound and describe what isn't making sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on this a bit more...\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a standard complaint about Haskell (and strongly-typed languages in general) that typing is a pain in the lower back to deal with.  It might be so in Java/TypeScript/Rust/etc... but in Haskell, one will be able to write code without typing like in Python and Javascript **AND** without all the errors of mistyped logic (and misspelled stuff).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality though you'll get use to add types (or let the editor/LSP do it for you) as a good way to document the code. Especially with LSP nowadays it's not so useful but writing types instead of logic just help thinking."

No matter how many ORM packages people come up with in their favorite ecosystem, you'll eventually conclude that SQL is the way to go when dealing with manipulations over large datasets. But normally that means you end up writing SQL statements as string constant with a bunch of question marks for parameter holes, invoke some exec functions, map out the results, etc.  It's error prone, it's very error prone, it's incredibly error prone and even awkward.  If only you could write SQL as a first-class citizen in the rest of the logic you can express with your favorite syntax.\n",

That plus authentication, security, distributed computing, 3rd party APIs, Javascript/C++/Python ecosystems integration, ie the usual stuff.\n",

    "Then to document the code with *markdown* cells I also had to define every symbol (function, type) before it is used.  That ended up putting the code in the opposite way I'd normally write it, eg I'd normally go top-down and write the main logic (`listen`) first then define more and more of the details used by the main logic. Hopefully it's an order that you can live with. Probably that some blocks will seem pretty abstract when they show up, and you'll have to wait for the code that uses what they define to better understand how the Servant system works."
